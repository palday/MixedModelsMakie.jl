*MixedModelsMakie.jl* is a Julia package providing plotting capabilities for models fit with [MixedModels.jl](https://juliastats.org/MixedModels.jl/stable/).

Note that the functionality here is currently early alpha development and so breaking changes are expected as we refine the interface.
Following [SemVer](https://semver.org/), these minor releases before 1.0 can introduce these breaking changes.
The release of 1.0 will be indication that we believe the interface is reasonably stable.
